This project presents a comprehensive analysis of BlackRock Inc (BLK) and its stock price trends from January 2017 to December 2022. BlackRock is one of the largest asset managers globally, with 10 trillion USD in assets under management as of January 2022. Despite facing criticism for various issues, including its investments in China and anticompetitive behavior, the company has aimed to establish itself as a market leader in terms of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG).
To gain further insights into the stock price trend, various models were used, including the random walk model, regression models, and ARIMA models. The random walk model assumes that future movements in the stock price are independent of past movements and cannot be predicted based on historical data. This implies that the stock price has no inherent tendency to move in any particular direction over time, and any price movements are simply the result of random fluctuations. Regression models use time as an explanatory variable to explain or predict the value of the stock price at any given time based on the time itself, as well as any other relevant variables that may a↵ect the stock price. ARIMA models take into account the autoregressive and moving average components of the data, as well as any di↵erencing that may be necessary to stabilize the variance of the time series.
The best ARIMA model was found to be ARIMA (0,1,0), based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It is important to note that ARIMA models are not perfect predictors of the future, and any forecasts should be
used in conjunction with other analysis and risk management strategies.
